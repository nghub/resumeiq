          If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information

          otherwise made clear to you on the relevant website.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

          your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground">
          We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal 
          information we process. However, please also remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself is 100% secure. Although 
          we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our website is at your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
        <p className="text-foreground">
          We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the website, you represent that you 
          are at least 18. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate

          Depending on your region (like the EEA, UK, or Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may 
          include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure;

        <p className="text-foreground">
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you 
          can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At 
          this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not 
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.
